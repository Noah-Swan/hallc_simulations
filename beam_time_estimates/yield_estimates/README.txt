Directory Structure
====================

xsec_not_corrected/
------------------
This directory contains data file / plots of the
simulated JML Paris FSI yields before cross-section corrections
(i.e, the simulated yields are not corrected for differences observed
between commissioning data and model.) Also, the 580 MeV/c setting
had not been added to the yield estimates at this time.

xsec_corrected/
------------------
This directory contains data files / plots of the
simulated JML Paris FSI yields after cross-section corrections, defined
as:  R = commissioning_dataXsec / JML_Paris_FSI_Xsec from the commissioning
experiment. This is to account for the differences observed between the
measureed cross-sections and JML Paris FSI model during commisioning.
The corrected yileds are a more realistic simulated representation of the
measured yields during commissioning.
