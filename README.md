# Hall C Simulations

This repository contains directories relevant to the
simulations (mainly using SIMC) done at Jefferson Lab Hall C.

### Directory Structure

*macros/* : relevant macros used to calculate the central kinematics of an experiment before simulations are done. For example, calculate the H(e,e'p) elastics kinematics__
*simc_heep/*: simulation data files/code used for hydrogen elastics *H(e,e'p)* reaction analysis__
*simc_deep/*: simulation data files/code used for deuteron break-up *D(e,e'p)n* reaction analysis__
